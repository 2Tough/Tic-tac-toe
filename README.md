# tic-tac-toe
A simple game project.

This branch is done according to the Odin Project guidelines. It has to use module and factories. 
The first goal is to get a human vs human gameboard going and then implement an easy AI or unbeatable AI.

This was by far one of the projects I was more frustrated with but most rewarding as well. Though a simple concept, having modules operating in their own enviroment and how to make them interact with each other was a new way of building for me. 

I learned how to use factories and how to divide projects in modules and working on them individually, which is something I wanted to do in previous projects.

I watched tutorials and followed along them, but I really wanted to build this with my own code, though simple, but understandable and easy to follow.

Though there are other methods for defining the win and draw conditions, my method is my own, which I find is the easiest to understand.

Nevertheless, by watching other tutorials I did learn about different methods to check for winning conditions, how to change turns, etc.

I got a lot of practice with modules and how to make code more modular after going through this project.
